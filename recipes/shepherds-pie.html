            </ul>
            
            <p>Mashed Potato:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1.2kg (2.2 lb) potatoes, peeled and cut into 2.5cm / 1" cubes</li>
                <li>2/3 cup (165 ml) milk</li>
                <li>2 tbsp (30g) butter</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Crust:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 – 3 tbsp grated parmesan</li>
                <li>2 tbsp (30g) butter</li>
                <li>Fresh thyme leaves, optional garnish</li>
            </ul>
            
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 1 minute. Then add carrots, celery, thyme and rosemary. Cook for 3 minutes or until softened and sweet.</li>
                <li>Turn heat up to high. Add lamb and cook, breaking it up as you go, until browned.</li>
                <li>Add flour and mix in. Add tomato paste, broth, red wine, bouillon cube, Worcestershire sauce and bay leaves. Stir well.</li>
                <li>Bring to simmer, then turn down heat so it is simmering rapidly - I have it on medium. Cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it reduces down to a thick gravy consistency.</li>
                <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Transfer Filling to 1.5 litre / quart pie baking dish. Stir through peas. Cover, then refrigerate to cool for 1 - 2 hours or overnight</li>     
            </ol>

        <p>Assemble:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 180C/350F.</li>
                <li>Cook potatoes in boiling water for 15 minutes or until soft. Drain then return to pot on turned off stove. Allow to steam dry for 30 seconds or so.</li>
                <li>Add butter and mash until melted, then add milk, salt and pepper. Mash until it's soft and smooth (ie spreadable, but not sloppy), adjusting with a touch more milk if required.</li>
                <li>Spread mash onto pie, use a fork to draw squiggles over the surface. Sprinkle with parmesan, drizzle with butter.</li>
                <li>Bake for 30 - 40 minutes or until deep golden on top and bubbling on the edges. Stick a knife into the middle to ensure it is piping hot.</li>
                <li>Stand for 5 minutes before serving, garnished with fresh thyme leaves if desired.</li>
            </ol>
